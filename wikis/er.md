# ER: Requirements Specification Component

> To redefine project management, with ProPlanner we envision a platform where project teams thrive through efficient planning, active communication, and remote collaboration. The primary goal of our project is to empower organizations to achieve their project goals with ease and precision.

## A1: ProPlanner

The ProPlanner platform is being developed by a dedicated group of students as a web-based information system for project management.
With the increasing emergence of fast-paced environments, from business to educational contexts, effective project management is crucial.
Companies require time-saving solutions to develop their products, while educators seek to bridge the gap between theory and practice in project management. Thus, we propose ProPlanner as a system able to bring project planning, active communication, and remote collaboration under one roof.

#### Main Features

This platform will allow users not only to create projects and their respective teams but also to define tasks, allowing strict role definitions for each team member.
Its intuitive design will make it easy to search and filter tasks according to their priority and date, ensuring a reduction in access time among the numerous tasks a project consists of.
Projects will dispose of forums, enabling communication among team members, receiving constant feedback from members and their coordinators, and promoting the sharing of useful resources concerning the project. A notification system is also included. Users are notified whenever a task is assigned to them or is already completed, an invitation to collaborate is accepted, or a project coordinator is switched.

#### User Profiles

Regarding the users, there are 5 main types: **Guest** users, who are not logged in and have read-only access to the application's functionalities, can receive email invitations with a redirection link to the signup page. After signing up, they become **Authenticated** users, who are allowed to create and view their projects and add them to their favorites list. Once an authenticated user is assigned to a project, they become a **Project Member**. Project members are not restricted to project creation since they can create and manage tasks, comment, and assign users to tasks. The **Project Coordinator** plays a role of higher importance, being responsible for adding and removing project members, editing project details, and archiving them. **Administrators'** accounts are independent of user accounts since they cannot take part in projects and are only allowed to browse and view their details.
